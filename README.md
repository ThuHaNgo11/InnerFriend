# InnerFriend - journal writing app

InnerFriend simplifies journal writing by allowing users to write on-the-go, add visual elements through image uploads or AI-generated images, and organize their entries for easy reflection.

## Motivations
* Addressing Limitations: InnerFriend aims to tackle the drawbacks of traditional journaling methods, offering improved convenience, organization, and accessibility for users.
* Minimalistic Design Focus: By prioritizing simplicity and minimizing distractions (no ads or other services such as guided meditation), InnerFriend provides an environment that allows users to focus solely on writing, thoughts, and reflections.
* Enhanced Journaling Experience: Through its user-friendly platform and simplified design, InnerFriend aims to enhance the journaling experience, encouraging consistent and meaningful self-expression and reflection.

## Project aims and objectives
To develop a complete mobile application that enables users to write journals more interactively and conveniently. In addition to journal entries of text and images, AI features of text to speech/speech to text and image generation were incorporated to further elevate user engagement.

## App features
* **User Authentication**: create an account, log in securely, and manage personal information.
* **Diary Entry Creation**: writing text (title, content, etc), adding images (upload from local or generated by AI)
* **Viewing the past entries**: seeing journals in list view, select a particular journal to view details
* **Image gallery**: view collection of uploaded/generated images
* **Edit/Delete journal**: update text/image or completely remove the entry.
* **Privacy and Security**: Users' personal information and diary entries should be securely stored and protected from unauthorized access.

## Technologies used
* **Frontend**: Built using the React Native framework for an interactive and responsive user interface.
* **Backend**: Utilized NodeJS and ExpressJS for robust backend development.
* **Database**: MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.
* **Additional Services**: Integrated Firebase Store for image storage and leveraged OpenAI's Dalle model for image generation

## System architecture
1. Life cycle without backend interaction: A1 -> A5
2. Life cycle with backend interaction: A1 -> A2 -> B1 -> B5 -> A3 -> A4 ->A5
3. Life cycle with extended services: A1 -> A2 -> C1 -> C2 -> A3 -> A4 -> A5
4. Interact with Firebase service: A1 -> A2 -> D1 -> D2 -> A3 -> A4 -> A5
